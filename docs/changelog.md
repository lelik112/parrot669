# PARROT 669 changelog

## 2026-09-21 — Airbnb iCal synchronization

- Hosts can connect an Airbnb iCal export URL after attaching the matching Airbnb listing.
- The backend validates that the listing id inside the iCal URL matches the property's Airbnb listing id.
- Sync happens immediately on connect, manually on demand, and automatically about once per hour.
- Imported iCal data is normalized to event kind + date range + UID; reservation descriptions/phone fragments are not stored.
- `Reserved` events block PARROT search for overlapping nights.
- `Airbnb (Not available)` events are retained for host visibility but do not block PARROT physical availability.
- Unknown summaries are retained as unknown and do not silently block availability.
- Calendar URLs remain server-side and are never returned by dashboard/public APIs.

## 2026-09-21 — optional pricing and interval stitching

- Availability periods can carry an optional nightly price in EUR cents.
- External listings can carry an optional cleaning fee.
- Guest search can show all results or only results with complete pricing.
- If any requested night has no price, the result has no price estimate; priced-only mode excludes it.
- Price is explicitly indicative; final terms and other charges remain with the host/external listing.
- New and edited availability periods cannot overlap.
- Adjacent half-open periods are allowed and search now stitches them across boundaries by night.
- Kept interval rows rather than one database row per day; requested nights are expanded only inside the search query.
- Main-site Housing entry is visually separated from ordinary service/navigation links.

## 2026-09-21 — owner state and date semantics

- Host page now reloads properties, external listing and PARROT availability from an authenticated backend dashboard endpoint on every page load.
- localStorage is credentials-only; it is no longer authoritative for property/listing/calendar state.
- Search results use the owner-entered property title instead of the city name.
- Date ranges now use hotel semantics: `[check-in, checkout)`.
- Same-day check-in/check-out is rejected as a zero-night stay.
- Host availability periods also require `to > from`.
- Existing production availability rows are migrated by adding one day to the old inclusive end date, preserving their previous meaning.
- Worker proxy allows the new owner dashboard route.

## 2026-09-21 — Barcelona scope and deletion

- Added property deletion and external-listing deletion with owner-token authorization.
- MVP restricted to Barcelona with internal `city_code = barcelona`.
- Search includes owner nickname but does not expose raw contact details.
- Main navigation groups guest search and host tools under the Housing product area.

## 2026-09-21 — capacity, minimum stay and Airbnb IDs

- Added sleeping-place capacity and minimum stay.
- Search enforces both.
- Hosts enter an Airbnb listing ID; PARROT generates the external URL.
- Search moved from the homepage to `/search.html`.
